# Week-_8-_-MySQL-

Projects Database
This project aims to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application interfacing with a MySQL database. This application uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to connect to the MySQL database. The database tables are diagrammed using Draw.io to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). SQL statements are written to create the necessary tables for the project, and a MySQL client (DBeaver) is utilized to actualize these tables.

Objectives
In this project, you will:

Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) in Draw.io with entities and relationship lines.
Understand crows' foot notation and apply that knowledge in an Entity Relationship Diagram.
Apply your knowledge of DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements to create tables using a MySQL client (DBeaver).
The exercises below guide you through this process. Note the icon: make sure to include this functionality in your video showcase.

Exercises
The project comprises five tables: project, material, step, category, and project_category.

Detailed information on each table, such as column definitions, data type, and whether or not the field is nullable, can be found in the project specification.

Entity-Relationship Diagram
The ERD will contain the five table entities and show the relationships between the tables. The ERD should be saved and uploaded to your GitHub repository for Week 2.

Steps to create the ERD:

Follow the instructions in the Week 2 Installation Instructions to download Draw.io or use the online tool.
In Draw.io, create a new drawing and expand "Entity Relation" in the tool palette on the left.
Use Draw.io to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram.
Project Schema
You will create a new file and write DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE SQL statements for the five tables in the DIY Projects schema. The statements will be run in DBeaver, creating the tables.

Steps to create the schema:

In the mysql-java project in Eclipse, create a file named "projects-schema.sql" in the src/main/resources directory.
Add DROP TABLE statements at the top of the file to drop the tables in the correct order.
Write the CREATE TABLE statements.
Paste the SQL into the DBeaver SQL editor. Run all DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements.
After finishing these steps, push your project to GitHub.
